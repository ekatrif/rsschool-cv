## About

Since September 2021, I have been actively immersed in frontend development, learned the basics of working with Git, started writing logic in Javascript, got acquainted with Vue.js, started using Webpack and Gulp to build projects, while improving my page layout skills.
At the moment I'm taking an advanced frontend development course from The Rolling Scopes School and improving my knowledge of technical English.

Your vacancy attracted me by the fact that you need a specialist who will work at the intersection of technologies and no-code tools. I have quite a lot of experience in low-code development of sites on CMS Wordpress and Tilda with minimal interference in the layout and code of ready-made modules and, at the same time, a solid knowledge of the basics of classical frontend development. I can adaptively compose elements and pages of any complexity, write logic in Vanilla JS, I have experience with Vue.js.

At the moment, my favorite development tool is Vue.js, I like how the framework organizes the logic of the code and ensures the stability of the finished application.
