## About

Since September 2021, I have been actively immersed in frontend development, learned the basics of working with Git, started writing logic in Javascript, got acquainted with Vue.js, started using Webpack and Gulp to build projects, improved my page layout skills. Presently I'm taking an advanced frontend development course from The Rolling Scopes School and improving my knowledge of technical English.

At the moment, my favorite development tool is Vue.js, I like how the framework organizes the logic of the code and ensures the stability of the deployed application.
